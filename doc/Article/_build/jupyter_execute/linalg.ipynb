    "# Linear Algebra, Handling of Arrays and more Python Features\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this set of lectures is to review some central linear algebra algorithms that we will need in our \n",
    "data analysis part and in the construction of Machine Learning algorithms (ML). \n",
    "This will allow us to introduce some central programming features of high-level languages like Python and \n",
    "compiled languages like C++ and/or Fortran. \n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the introductory notes, these series of lectures focuses both on using\n",
    "central Python packages like **tensorflow** and **scikit-learn** as well\n",
    "as writing your own codes for some central ML algorithms. The\n",
    "latter can be written in a language of your choice, be it Python, Julia, R,\n",
    "Rust, C++, Fortran etc. In order to avoid confusion however, in these lectures we will limit our\n",
    "attention to Python, C++ and Fortran.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Matrix and vector handling packages\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several central software packages for linear algebra and eigenvalue problems. Several of the more\n",
    "popular ones have been wrapped into ofter software packages like those from the widely used text **Numerical Recipes**. The original source codes in many of the available packages are often taken from the widely used\n",
    "software package LAPACK, which follows two other popular packages\n",
    "developed in the 1970s, namely EISPACK and LINPACK.  We describe them shortly here.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * LINPACK: package for linear equations and least square problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * LAPACK:package for solving symmetric, unsymmetric and generalized eigenvalue problems. From LAPACK's website <http://www.netlib.org> it is possible to download for free all source codes from this library. Both C/C++ and Fortran versions are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * BLAS (I, II and III): (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that provide standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix operations. Blas I is vector operations, II vector-matrix operations and III matrix-matrix operations. Highly parallelized and efficient codes, all available for download from <http://www.netlib.org>.\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with matrices and vectors a central issue is memory\n",
    "handling and allocation. If our code is written in Python the way we\n",
    "declare these objects and the way they are handled, interpreted and\n",
    "used by say a linear algebra library, requires codes that interface\n",
    "our Python program with such libraries. For Python programmers,\n",
    "**Numpy** is by now the standard Python package for numerical arrays in\n",
    "Python as well as the source of functions which act on these\n",
    "arrays. These functions span from eigenvalue solvers to functions that\n",
    "compute the mean value, variance or the covariance matrix. If you are\n",
    "not familiar with how arrays are handled in say Python or compiled\n",
    "languages like C++ and Fortran, the sections in this chapter may be\n",
    "useful. For C++ programmer, **Armadillo** is widely used library for\n",
    "linear algebra and eigenvalue problems. In addition it offers a\n",
    "convenient way to handle and organize arrays. We discuss this library\n",
