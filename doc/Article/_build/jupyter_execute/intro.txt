# Ten Algorithms that shook the World

## Introduction

The aim of this set of lectures is to review some central linear algebra algorithms that we will need in our 
data analysis part and in the construction of Machine Learning algorithms (ML). 
This will allow us to introduce some central programming features of high-level languages like Python and 
compiled languages like C++ and/or Fortran.
