From linear algebra to machine learning; ten central algorithms for studying quantum mechanical many-particle problems



Monte Carlo methods, machine learning, eigenvalue problems, optimization, many-body problems, computational quantum mechanics



Being able to solve and simulate quantum mechanical few and many-body
problems, lays the foundation for deeper insights about the equations
of motion and the pertinent forces of our microscopic world, with
applications to essentially all fields of physics and important
applications in emerging fields like quantum computing and quantum
technologies. In this contribution we will present central algorithms
that are used to solve few- and many-body quantum mechanical problems,
starting with well-known eigenvalue formulations of quantum mechanical
problems, before we move on to non-linear methods, stochastic methods
and finally deep neural networks.  Every example is accompanied by
numerical implementations in form of Python codes and
jupyter-notebooks, allowing thereby the reader to get started with own
research and to reproduce the results that are presented.
